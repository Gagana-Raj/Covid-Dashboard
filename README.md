# COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a **COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard** using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights and analytics on the global vaccination trends and distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The visualizations help stakeholders understand the vaccination rates, geographic distribution, and key metrics to inform decision-making.

## Features

- **Global Vaccination Progress**: Track the number of vaccinated individuals by country, continent, and globally.
- **Daily and Cumulative Vaccination Data**: Monitor daily vaccination rates and total vaccinations over time.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Analyze vaccination rates by age groups, gender, or other demographic factors (if available in the dataset).
- **Geographic Visualization**: A map-based visualization showing vaccination distribution across countries and regions.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Understand the trends over time, with the ability to filter by different time periods.
- **Comparison of Vaccine Manufacturers**: Insights into which vaccines are being administered and how they are distributed across different regions.
- **Interactive Filters**: Dynamic filters to drill down on specific countries, regions, or time frames for more in-depth analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Source**: https://github.com/Gagana-Raj/Covid-Dashboard/blob/main/country_vaccinations.csv.
- **Power Query**: Used for cleaning and transforming raw data.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Applied for advanced calculations and dynamic data modeling.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the publicly available dataset by **Our World in Data**, which provides up-to-date information on COVID-19 vaccinations worldwide. The dataset includes metrics such as:

- Total vaccinations
- People vaccinated
- People fully vaccinated
- Daily vaccinations
- Vaccination by country and region

## Installation & Setup

1. **Download Data**:[covid datasets] https://github.com/Gagana-Raj/Covid-Dashboard/blob/main/country_vaccinations.csv
   
2. **Power BI Setup**:
   - Open Power BI and load the dataset.
   - Perform any necessary transformations using Power Query.
   - Build the necessary visuals such as bar charts, line charts, and maps.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Use Power BI's visualization features to create interactive reports and visuals.
   - Utilize DAX to create custom metrics and calculations as needed.
